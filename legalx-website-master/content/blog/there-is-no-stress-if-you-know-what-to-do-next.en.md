LegalX believes in planning ahead, for the whole team. This means knowing the key questions of “Who, What, When, Where, How, Why, If and What if” well in advance for any deal execution.

A workflow can be constructed collaboratively by team-members chipping in their respective tokens of experience and precedents. The finalized workflow can further be refined through the testing of time and real use cases. 

Our workflow builder does that. Multiple professionals from senior to junior levels can contribute to the best practice of your company. Such intellectual properties can be implemented to a real project calendar efficiently and effectively, keeping everyone on the same page.

Imagine a bank of such workflows bringing in years of experience honed by _collective intelligence_. It goes beyond risk and resource management but the preservation of valuable intangible assets that vastly improve the quality of service over time.

Why wait? Join us at LegalX by speaking to a [LegalX Practice Advisor](https://www.legalx.ai/contact/) and experience the power of real teamwork through us today.
